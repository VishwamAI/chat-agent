# Evaluation Metrics Implementation Instructions for Vishwamai Model

This document provides detailed instructions for implementing evaluation metrics in the `VishwamaiForCausalLM` class within the `model.py` file. Evaluation metrics are essential for assessing the performance of the model on various tasks, such as text generation, MMLU, math, and reasoning.

## Steps to Implement Evaluation Metrics

1. **Add Evaluation Metrics Imports:**
   - Open the `model.py` file.
   - Add the necessary imports for evaluation metrics at the beginning of the file.

   ```python
   from transformers import pipeline
   from datasets import load_metric
   ```

2. **Define Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Inside the `VishwamaiForCausalLM` class, define methods to calculate evaluation metrics such as perplexity and BLEU score.

   ```python
   def calculate_perplexity(self, generated_texts: List[str], references: List[str]) -> float:
       metric = load_metric("perplexity")
       results = metric.compute(predictions=generated_texts, references=references)
       return results["perplexity"]

   def calculate_bleu(self, generated_texts: List[str], references: List[str]) -> float:
       metric = load_metric("bleu")
       results = metric.compute(predictions=generated_texts, references=references)
       return results["bleu"]
   ```

3. **Integrate Evaluation Metrics into `generate` Method:**
   - Modify the `generate` method to include evaluation metrics calculation after generating the text.

   ```python
   def generate(
       self,
       prompts: Union[str, Sequence[str]],
       device: Any,
       output_len: int = 100,
       temperature: float = 0.95,
       top_p: float = 1.0,
       top_k: int = 100,
       num_beams: int = 5,
       references: Optional[List[str]] = None,
   ) -> Union[str, Sequence[str]]:
       # Existing code for text generation...

       # Calculate evaluation metrics if references are provided
       if references:
           generated_texts = [self.tokenizer.decode(tokens) for tokens in token_ids]
           perplexity = self.calculate_perplexity(generated_texts, references)
           bleu = self.calculate_bleu(generated_texts, references)
           print(f"Perplexity: {perplexity}, BLEU: {bleu}")

       return results
   ```

4. **Test the Implementation:**
   - After making the changes, test the `generate` method to ensure that the evaluation metrics are calculated correctly.
   - Verify that the perplexity and BLEU scores are printed and reflect the model's performance on the provided references.

By following these steps, you will implement evaluation metrics in the `VishwamaiForCausalLM` class, allowing you to assess the model's performance on various tasks.
