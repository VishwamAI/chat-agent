# Instructions for integrating text-to-text generation features from identified models into the Vishwamai model

# Step 1: Explore the documentation of the selected models
# Visit the Hugging Face model pages for the identified models and review their documentation to understand their capabilities and usage.

# Example models to explore:
# - microsoft/kosmos-2.5: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/kosmos-2.5
# - google/flan-t5-base: https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base
# - google/flan-t5-large: https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large
# - CohereForAI/aya-101: https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/aya-101
# - google/flan-t5-small: https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small
# - google/flan-t5-xxl: https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl

# Step 2: Extract relevant code snippets or configurations
# Identify the key components and configurations from the selected models that are relevant to text-to-text generation. This may include model architectures, tokenization methods, and generation parameters.

# Step 3: Adapt the extracted code to fit within the Vishwamai model's architecture
# Modify the extracted code snippets or configurations to integrate them into the Vishwamai model. Ensure that the changes are compatible with the existing codebase and do not introduce any errors.

# Example integration steps:
# - Update the `generate` method in the `model.py` file to include advanced sampling strategies and decoding techniques from the selected models.
# - Enhance the `bi_directional_generate` method to include additional parameters for controlling the generation process, such as temperature, top_p, and top_k.
# - Implement new evaluation metrics for text generation, such as BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and CIDEr, based on the selected models' evaluation methods.

# Step 4: Test the integrated features
# After integrating the features, thoroughly test the Vishwamai model to ensure that the new text-to-text generation capabilities are working as expected. Use existing test scripts or create new ones to validate the changes.

# Step 5: Document the changes
# Update the `README.md` file and any other relevant documentation to reflect the new features and capabilities of the Vishwamai model. Provide clear instructions on how to use the new text-to-text generation features.

# Note: The user should perform these steps in their local environment to avoid any issues with server access or permissions.
