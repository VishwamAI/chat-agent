# VishwamAI Model Documentation

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/chat-agent.git
   cd chat-agent
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dependency Installation
Ensure that the following dependencies are installed:
- TensorFlow
- Haiku
- Optax
- JAX
- Matplotlib

## Model Training

### Initiate Model Training
To start training the VishwamAI model, run the following command:
```bash
python3 scripts/train_vishwamai_model.py
```

### Training Configuration
The training script `train_vishwamai_model.py` is configured to run on a CPU environment. Ensure that the CUDA drivers are not required for this setup.

### Monitoring Training
The training process will log information about the training progress, including loss values and memory usage. Monitor the logs to ensure that the training is proceeding as expected.

## Model Evaluation

### Evaluate Model Performance
After training, evaluate the model's performance on the MMLU benchmark and other benchmarks like MATH reasoning and HellaSwag. Use the provided evaluation scripts to verify the model's accuracy.

### Evaluation Script
Run the evaluation script to test the model's performance:
```bash
python3 scripts/test_vishwamai_performance.py
```

## Model Usage

### Inference
To use the trained model for inference, load the saved model parameters and pass the input data to the model. Follow the example below to perform inference:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pickle

# Load the trained model parameters
with open("vishwamai_model_params.pkl", "rb") as f:
    params = pickle.load(f)

# Initialize the model
model = VishwamAIModel()

# Perform inference
input_data = ...  # Replace with your input data
logits = model(input_data)
predictions = tf.argmax(logits, axis=-1)
print(predictions)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **ModuleNotFoundError:** Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- **TypeError:** Verify that the input data types match the expected types in the model.
- **Memory Exhaustion:** Monitor memory usage and adjust batch sizes or use gradient checkpointing to reduce memory consumption.
