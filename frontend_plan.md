# Frontend Interface Plan for Chat Functionality

## Overview
The frontend interface will provide a user-friendly chat interface to interact with the SSI chat functionality. It will consist of a text input field for user messages and a display area for the chat history, including the user's messages and the system's responses.

## Components
- Text input field: Allows users to type their messages.
- Submit button: Sends the user's message to the backend for processing.
- Chat display area: Shows the conversation history.
- Error handling: Displays any error messages or issues with the backend processing.

## Integration with Backend
- The frontend will make POST requests to a backend endpoint with the user's message.
- The backend will process the message using the `generate_response.py` script and return the generated response.
- The frontend will display the response in the chat display area.

## Safety Measures
- Input validation: Ensure that user input is sanitized before being sent to the backend.
- Response filtering: Implement filters to handle any inappropriate content in the model's responses.

## Technologies
- HTML/CSS for the layout and styling of the chat interface.
- JavaScript for handling user interactions and communication with the backend.

## Next Steps
- Define the API endpoint for the backend.
- Implement the frontend interface with basic styling.
- Test the integration with the backend to ensure proper communication and response handling.
